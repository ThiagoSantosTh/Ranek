  <p>This application was developed during the Origamind course in Vue.Js.</p>

  <p>
 In this project we built an awesome landing page from the beginning. 

  We start by creating the Style Guide. After that, we designed the UI concept. And finally we developed the page using VueJs on the Front end and to communicate with the back I created an API in WordPress.
